# Skeleton-Sentinel
A pixel-art desktop guardian that reacts to your PC's hardware stress.
🛡️ Skeleton Sentinel
A gamified, pixel-art system monitor that brings a "soul" to your hardware telemetry.

Skeleton Sentinel is not just another hardware monitor. It’s a desktop guardian that lives and breathes based on your PC's workload. Built with Python and PyQt6, it transforms dry CPU/RAM data into a dynamic pixel-art performance.

🌟 Key Features
🎮 Dynamic State Machine
The sentinel reacts to your system stress with 6 distinct, hand-picked pixel-art animations:

Idle: Peaceful guarding when your CPU is chilling (< 20%).

Walk: Patrolling your desktop during routine tasks (20% - 60%).

Attack: Combat mode activated when heavy processes strike (60% - 90%).

React: A "surprised" reaction to sudden CPU spikes (> 25% jump).

Hit: Visual feedback when memory usage is critically high (> 85%).

Dead: Total collapse when the system hits its absolute limit (> 95%).

🛠️ Technical Prowess
Ultra-Lightweight: Minimal footprint on your system resources (monitored by psutil).

Transparent Overlay: A frameless, "Always-on-Top" window that integrates seamlessly with your wallpaper.

Full Customization: All thresholds and animation paths are externalized in config.json for easy "reskinning."

📦 Getting Started
Download: Head over to the Releases page and grab the SkeletonSentinel_v1.0.zip.

Run: Extract the files and double-click SkeletonSentinel.exe.

Interact: Watch him struggle as you open a Chrome tab or render a 3D model.

💡 Why Star this Project?
As an IoT Engineering student ranked 5th out of 60, I designed this to prove that system tools can be both functional and fun. If you like the idea of a skeleton guardian "dying" for your heavy workloads, give it a ⭐!
